# Virtual-Plant-Monitoring-System
An IoT-based Virtual Plant Monitoring System that tracks real-time soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light exposure using sensors and microcontroller programming. Includes data visualization, alert system, and environmental monitoring features.
# 🌱 Virtual Plant Monitoring System (Java)

## 📌 Overview
The Virtual Plant Monitoring System is a Java-based application designed to simulate the health, growth, and maintenance of a plant. The system tracks essential plant parameters such as **water level, sunlight exposure, temperature, and growth stage**, allowing users to monitor plant health in a virtual environment.

This project demonstrates the concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, Java classes, file handling, GUI/console output, and real-time simulation logic.

## 🎯 Project Objective
- To simulate the behavior of a real plant using Java classes and functions.
- To apply OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism).
- To visually track plant health using a simple user interface or console.
- To understand condition monitoring and automated feedback systems.
